        <h2>Morzine</h2>
        <p>
          Morzine is a thriving Alpine village set deep in the Chablais
          mountain range between Lake Geneva and Mont Blanc, by the France-Switzerland
          border. It has grown over the years to become a charming ski resort in winter
          and a popular biking destination in summer. It's roots as an old French
          farming and mining town are apparent in the village today, where local
          produce is available at the weekly market,
          and many of the chalets sport local slate roofs.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        Morzine is just over an hour's drive from Geneva Airport and is located the
        middle of one of the biggest ski areas in the world - the Portes du Soleil
        ski domain. Morzine's ski area is filled with cruisy, tree-lined blue and
        red runs, and it's also linked directly to the ski resorts of Avoriaz and
        Les Gets. Although the village is situated at a relatively low 900 metres,
        it's network of lifts reaches the panoramic Chamossière at 1800 metres, and
        Avoriaz, at 2100 metres. You may not be able to ski back to your accommodation
        at the end of the day, but the extensive lift system and free shuttle
        services ensure you'll find it easy to get back to your accommodation
        whatever the snow cover.

      <h2>Summer</h2>
      <p>
        The low level traditional chalet-style buildings in Morzine help preserve
        the town's character and charm. It has the greatest selection of holiday
        rental chalets in the area, most of which are independently run. This
        style of accommodation, along with the attractive skiing provides the
        quintessential ski holiday experience, making Morzine a firm favourite
        with families and groups of friends. In the last few years, Morzine has
        invested in new lifts and sports facilities. New bars, luxury catered
        chalets and high quality restaurants have also begun to emerge, allowing
        Morzine to compete favourably with many of the big-name resorts in the
        Alps. With access to 426km of pistes, great quality accommodation and
        buzzy nightlife, Morzine is one of our favourite ski resorts.

      <h2>Winter</h2>
      <p>
        Morzine and the connected resort of Les Gets have a combined 120
        kilometres of pistes, accessed by 26 chairlifts, 3 cable cars and
        14 drag lifts. There are 5 green pistes, 29 blue pistes, 28 red pistes
        and 9 black pistes. The skiing here is renowned for its picturesque
        tree-lined runs, with plenty of gentle pistes for beginners and
        intermediates. More advanced skiers can use the lift system to
        explore the whole of the Portes du Soleil ski area -  it encompasses
        eight French resorts of Abondance, Avoriaz, La Chapelle d’Abondance,
        Châtel, Les Gets, Montriond, Avoriaz, St Jean d’Aulps and six Swiss
        resorts of Champéry, Champoussin, Les Crosets, Morgins, Torgon and
        Val d’Illiez. Free shuttles also connect the centre of Morzine with
        all these resorts. Circuits (taking approximately 2h 30 min)
        organised according to ski levels have been designed to allow
        skiers to easily explore the various areas. Itineraries (blue,
        red or black runs) are marked by a specific mountain animal such
        as a bear, white rabbit, jackdaw, ibex or reindeer.

      <h2>Events</h2>
      <p>
        During the winter, Morzine has a packed events calendar. The biggest
        winter festival is the Rock des Pistes week in March, where live
        bands play up on the pistes, with many other concerts being held
        in resort during the evenings. Throughout the rest of the season,
        some of the bars on the pistes have apres-ski parties starting
        around 2pm. Later on back in Morzine, many of the bars host live
        bands and DJ's both for apres-ski and late night parties. Morzine
        also prides itself on providing family entertainments. The school
        holidays are particularly fun, with plenty of special activities
        laid on for children. Check our Whats On Calendar to see what's on
        during your stay.

      <h2>Skiing</h2>
      <p>
        If you don’t ski, yet still want to be active try snowshoeing,
        ice climbing, ice skating, or take an ice dive into the chilly Lake
        Montriand. If swishing through the snow with a bit more style is
        more your thing, you could take a horse-drawn sleigh ride or go
        husky dog sledding. In Morzine itself there is a cinema, a bowling
        alley, and plenty of sports shops to browse in. Get your fill of
        local produce at the weekly Morzine market (held on Wednesday mornings),
        or buy presents for those back home in the town's gift shops.
